## Challenge & Inspiration:

### Challenge:

üéØ The aim of creating an onboarding process is to allow our users to get up and running with the platform:

- in a short amount of time,
- with total autonomy.

Because, as we all know, the sooner he gets to experience the value of our product (preferably in an "aha" moment üòâ), the more likely he will be encouraged to return and use our solution.

‚òùüèº However, knowing our typical user profile, we must consider his lack of speed, tech language, motor skills, and even concentration.

‚û°Ô∏è This is why our onboarding has to be sleek and simple so as not to overwhelm users (especially new users).

‚ö†Ô∏è The next step the user must take must be simple to spot and understand while providing him with a vision of his progress (so he knows how long the process will take and be incentivized to complete it instead of dropping it because god knows how long will it take).

And of course, let's think üì± mobile-first. Not just to have a responsive layout, but it also helps us know what is nice-to-have and must-have (especially when we need to stay minimalistic).

### User Experience (basic information)

Based on the brief I was provided, I designed a flowchart that simplifies the first part of onboarding; the basic user information.

![UX flowchart](public/img/documentation/ux_flowchart.svg)

1 - üîç We first need to detect if we're dealing with a new user.

2 - If a user already has his dashboard set up, we will show him directly to the home screen where each entity's dashboard is listed and accessible (in a minimalistic view with one entity's dashboard = one clickable box with the entity's logo and name).

2b - If, on the other hand, we are dealing with a new user, an onboarding modale should pop up.

3 - First, he must provide his organization's name, description, and logo.

4 - Then, he must list all the admins' first names, last names, and emails (regardless of the entity they will manage if there are many).

5 - After that, he is asked if he needs to create entities (so each of his organization's entities gets its personalized dashboard).

6a - If there are no entities in his organization, he is redirected to the home screen where he can access his dashboard. The default entity generated will have the name, description, logo, and organization's admins.

6b - If there are many entities in his organization, he can list them and is l-only required to provide its name and list its admins (the description and logo can otherwise default to the organization's).

7 - He is finally redirected to the home screen to access his dashboard.

> disclaimer: instead of the home screen, I have integrated the payload so you can visualize its structure and the data collected (also because of the lack of time and have other priorities in this test ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

### Inspirations:

I started by spending some time on Dribbble and (of course) with a simple google search about onboarding for non-technical users.

I've saved a few here in [this collection](https://dribbble.com/n475u/collections/5611591-Magma-Onboarding-Inspiration).

But [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/client-onboarding-form-template/) and [ClearBrain](https://dribbble.com/shots/17907651-ClearBrain-s-first-log-in) were my main sources of inspiration.

## The front-end tech stack:

### General:

- The project is using Vue 3, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

- To avoid reinventing the wheel, [FormKit](https://formkit.com/) is used to generate form elements. It comes with built-in validation and offers the essential components needed. The default style theme is used to save time.

### Some details:

- Vue Meta is set up and used.

- i18n(internationalization plugin, a.k.a translation), Jest (unit testing) and Cypress (end-to-end testing) are configured but not used yet.

- Animations have been built using `vue2-animate`. Despite the name, this package is compatible with Vue 3. The confetti animation was integrated using `vue-confetti-explosion`.

### Code conventions:

- Common components are prefixed with `Base`.

- If you look at each component, I take great care in making sure everything is sorted (by category and alphabetically) and divided. It is a huge time saver in the long run because we do not have to think about where to put things or _decoding_ code.

- If you are using VSCode, the Tailwind's utility classes are automatically sorted on saving thanks to the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` plugin.

- I did not touch the eslint configuration and directly used the one with Vue-CLI.

- I also follow the angular convention when I write the message for my commits (a couple of words in parenthesis can be added at the end of each commit to specify why the modification was made).

### Going further:

- Making the breadcrumbs in our OnboardingProgression component clickable so a user can go back and edit his previous inputs. While also mentioning the total number of steps required to complete onboarding from the start.

- Adding a chat so users who have need assistance can get assisted, even though our UX is supposed to think as if he doesn't need us (but UX is something we improve through trial and error, and a chat can at least allow us to get that feedback to do so);

Not all users will reach out, so I recommend using hotjar or fullstory to spot where a user has trouble or how he behaves, which could give us some insights.

- Use i18n to automatically display text in French or English (translation is added right inside the component) when detecting the user preferred language.

- End-to-end tests have been set up using Cypress, and implementing them will ensure that while our application grows, it will be less prone to bugs we could introduce with new features.

- Right after end-to-end tests in terms of priorities in testing. Unit tests (that I've set up using Jest) could be very helpful to ensure that, for instance, a method or a computed are always providing the correct output when given a specific input.
